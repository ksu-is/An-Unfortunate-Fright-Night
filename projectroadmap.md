<li>We've researched text-based adventure games to find a base code to use for our project. We saw many codes, but we had to find one that was closer to the format we want to use. We came TextAdventureGame by HisRoyalFreshness and we forked the code into our repository. You can find it in our repository as project_code_template.py. </li>

<li>Before we found a code base, Shannon wrote some code using random time code found on YouTube.  This is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miuHrP2O7Jw">link</a> she referenced the code from. We decided not to use this code as our base because it didn't accoplish what we wanted our game to do. We wanted a text-based decision game and the code found on youtube was random. 
<li>Then we did research on how to put our game inside of a GUI. Then we did research on what code we needed in order to have our game perform inside a GUI. After some research we decided to use Tkinter because it is what most people have used and most easily accessible. Here are some of the links to our research: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrWHyqonGj8">GUI with Python's Tkinter, by Robert Jomar Malate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/CSSE120StartingCode/TkinterPractice/tree/master/more_examples">TkinterPractice</a>, and <a href="https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html">TkDocs</a>.</li>
<li>We found a Tkinter code that would have our script come in at a certain time using the Tkinter label after. But our example in our repository uses random but we will not use random.  Here is the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25753632/tkinter-how-to-use-after-method">Tkinter: How to Use after Method</a>.</li>
<li>So far the text is in the GUI but it all comes in at one time instead of scrolling slowly onto the screen. We also have a textfield where the user can type in their choice, like whether they want to use a,b,c,or d and then they press enter for their choice. We know how to put in a textfield and a submit button, but we haven't figured out how to have the user's choices affect the game.</li>
  <li>Shannon and Sydney will be working on script so that it will slowly come into the GUI. We will be working with tkinter_usingafter_gamescript.py.</li> 
 <li>We will find out why errors are in the code and how to correct it. For example, 
<li>We will be adding entry label and button tkinter labels into our code. It is the submit button and the textbox(entry). </li>
