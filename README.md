# An-Unfortunate-Fright-Night
Text-based horror game

An adventure text-based game that resembles the 1980s Zork that was made for DOS, but we want the game to be more about choosing your own path, whereas Zork already had a path for you that the user had to figure out.  We want it to have a silly story line that is centered around Halloween.  We will give the user several choices and paths to choose from.  For example, in the beginning of the game, we are going to give the user a choice of whether to go to the party or go to a haunted house.  The user can then choose which path to go on.  Before the user makes their choices, they are going to have an introduction in the beginning written in text so they have an idea of how the story will start.
